when two creatures breed, a series of steps is performed to create the child.
1. select a parent to copy the [[body type]] from.
2. on the parent selected, loop through all explicit [[descriptor trait|descriptor traits]], giving each one a random chance to be added to the child (only if there is an open slot available for that trait's cosmetic).
3. on the other parent, loop through all explicit (AND implicit, if a different body type to the parent selected in step 1) [[descriptor trait|descriptor traits]], giving each one a random chance to be added to the child (only if there is an open slot available for that trait's cosmetic).
4. for the primary and secondary color slots, randomly select a color from all parents primary and secondary colors (selected from both slots of both parents).
5. for the pattern type, randomly choose either parent's pattern type.

creatures of any type are able to breed with any other type. there are no restrictions on breeding
