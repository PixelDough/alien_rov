defines a descriptive trait about the creature

every one of these terms has an associated "cosmetic" which is added to a specific slot on a creature's model if the creature has this trait as an explicitly defined additional property.

generally, these can only come from creatures that have them as implicit traits (for example: sword from a creature with a swordfish body). however, some have other conditions in which they can appear, either a totally random chance per naturally spawned creature, or as a random chance from breeding.
