defines a descriptive trait about the creature

every one of these terms has a generic "part" it adds to the creature, based on the word. however, some combinations of terms can create a *specific* creature, with it's own custom model and behavior.

examples of generic traits:
- "suwi" adds axolotl frills to the creature's cheeks
- "utala" puts a sword in one of their fins
- "noka" adds legs to the creature
