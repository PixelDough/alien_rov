defines a descriptive trait about the creature

every one of these terms has an associated "cosmetic" which is added to a specific slot on a creature's model if the creature has this trait as an explicitly defined additional property.

generally, these can only come from creatures that have them as implicit traits (for example: sword from a creature with a swordfish body). however, some have other conditions in which they can appear, either a totally random chance per naturally spawned creature, or as a random chance from breeding.

a creature can end up with some double descriptor traits, in the event that they get the trait from a parent's implicit traits, but are a different body type to said parent. forexample, the child of a turtle and a rockfish might end up with the rockfish body (with "kiwen" as an implicit trait) and get the "kiwen" trait passed to it from the turtle parent. in this case, the word "kiwen" in the name will be replaced with "pi kiwen mute" to signify the higher amount of that trait.
